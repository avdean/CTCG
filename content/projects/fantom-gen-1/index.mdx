Fantom's Halloween then is what inspired me to make these cards in the first piece. I started doing these cards in batches of three, one for each of the marketplaces in Fantom. The first cards were created loosely on paintswap, the second as a zooCoin collection, and the third on Artion.

Unfortunately when Artion upgraded, the metadata used was no longer supported and so the entire collection was burned. While on paintswap, since they were created without a collection, they're dotted around paintswap but hard to find.


This leaves us with ZooCoin as the only full collection left.

You can see the rest of the cards, and buy what's available at the following link:
