Based on Polkadot's Substrate system, Moonbeam was released in January this year, making it very young in the crypto space. The key feature that Moonbeam can boast is the network's compatibility with Ethereum's tech. 

What this means is that Moonbeam marries the universally accepted experience of Ethereum with the interoperability and innovation that Polkadot brings to crypto.


Moonbeans Trading Galactic Co. is expected to go live soon:
