  - Fantom 2nd Generation Collection
---
The official home of Fantom's 2nd Generation NFTs, you'll also find the Fantom Theme Deck collection here, which were 32 cards that were sold as a whole collection, originally on Artion.

Fantom itself is a DAG network, which differs to a blockchain in that transactions can happen simultaneously due to its graphlike structure. It is both more efficient and performant, making it a very good substitute to blockchain tech.

You can see the rest of the collection and buy what's available at the following link:
