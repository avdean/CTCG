  - Fantom 2nd Generation Collection

While the first collection of Fantom cards were minted on ZooCoin, there was also a collection minted for Artion, however after Artion upgraded to v2, the contracts no longer functioned. Existing NFTs were migrated to PaintSwap, where the official collection for 2nd Generation Fantom cards now lives.
